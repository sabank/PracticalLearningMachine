#### Synopsis:
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

The following analysis uses a random forest prediction algorithm to accomplish this task. The model provided by this algorithm achieves a high prediction accuracy.

#### 1. Introduction
Six participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of barbell lifts in five different fashions, categorized as classes A, B, C, D and E. Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.

In this project, our goal was to use data from accelerometers on the bell, forearm, arm, and dumbell of the participants to build a prediction algorithm that takes these sensor readings and, given both a training and test dataset, correctly predicts the corresponding class (A to E).
